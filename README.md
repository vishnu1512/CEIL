# CEIL
CEIL: A scalable, resolution limit free approach for detecting communities in large networks

The python code can be executed by the command "python CommunityDetection.py ${INPUT_FILE_PATH} ${OUTPUT_FILE_PATH}".

The input file should contain the graph represented in edge list format. Each line in the input file represents an edge in the network. Sample.txt contains an example input file.

The output file will contain nodes and their community labels. Number of lines in the output file is equal to the number of nodes in the network. Each line is (Node [SPACE] CommunityLabelOfTheNode).
